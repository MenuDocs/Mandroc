## Info

Mandroc is MenuDocs' guild-bound Discord bot.
It brings features such as moderation, economy, tags system, and miscellaneous command to the server.

Mandroc wouldn't be up 24/7 without the help from our partner [Oxide Hosting](https://oxide.host "the official oxide site") with their reliable, fast and powerful hosting services.

This bot is strictly open-source so that members can assist with making Mandroc the best it can be.
